This repository was created to regenerate the Figures and reproduce the results from Akana, Yoe et al., under review.

To repeat the analyses and regenerate the figures:
1. Download the data from the Figshare repository.
2. Change the setup.R code to include the path to the data, input, and output directories
3. Source setup.R with the required R pacakges
4. Run main.R

The "Figures" folder that will be provided here will include the figures that this code regenerates.
