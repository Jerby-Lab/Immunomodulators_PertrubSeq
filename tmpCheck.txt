(b) Expression levels as in (a) and percentage of cells expressing each of the target genes (columns) in cells stratified based on the individual sgRNA (rows), shown for a subset of the sgRNAs. In red are sgRNAs that do not show a statistically significant overexpression of the target gene (BH FDR > 0.05, edgeR test). Extended Data Figure 5. Perturb-seq screen confirms CRISPRa on-target gene activation (part 2). Expression level (color bar, depicting average expression based on centered and scaled log1p-transformed tp10k values) and percentage of cells expressing each of the target genes (columns) in cells stratified based on the individual sgRNA (rows), shown for the subset of sgRNAs missing from Extended Data Fig. 4b. In red are sgRNAs that do not show a statistically significant overexpression of the target gene (BH FDR > 0.05, edgeR test).Extended Data Figure 6. Perturb-seq coculture GA signature validation in monoculture. GA signatures derived separately from monoculture (black and red) or coculture (blue and green) were applied to classify cells as subject to the pertaining gene activation, when considering all cells in the Perturb-seq monoculture datasets, or only control (NTC) and cells with the pertaining gene activation based on sgRNA detection. Only GA signatures with at least 5 genes were used as predictors. Mono (monoculture), co (coculture).Extended Data Figure 7. GA signature overlaps. (a) GA signatures stratified to their up- and down-regulated compartments (x axis, denoted as GA sub-signatures) and the log-transformed number of genes (y axis) that are differentially expressed only in monoculture (grey), only in coculture (black), or in both (cyan) conditions. (b) Overlap between pairs of GA sub-signatures (quantified as log10-transformed one-sided hypergeometric p-value, without correction for multiple hypothesis testing, bottom right color bar) shown as a clustered heatmap. The sub-signatures assignment to clusters is noted (C1-C5). The up- and down-regulated sub-signatures of sensitizing and resistance hits, respectively, are annotated as having a “sensitizing” effect. The up- and down-regulated sub-signatures of resistance and sensitizing hits, respectively, are annotated as having a “resistance” effect.Extended Data Figure 8.

The data includes 754 FOVs, all segmented and visualized in the same manner. (e) Tumor formation patterns in MC38 Pool2 versus Pool1. MC38 Pool2 (left) and Pool1 (right) cells were engrafted into a single flank of C57BL/6 mice and collected at the indicated day post-engraftment. In Pool2, draining inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) were collected (n = 4, top) and white tumor masses were observed at the injection site (bottom). In Pool1, typical MC38 tumors were observed and collected (n = 6). Scale bars were added after image acquisition based on the diameter of the tissue container. (f) Flow cytometry plots of white tumor mass and spleen samples excised from C57BL/6 mice (n = 2) inoculated with a single subcutaneous engraftment of Ifnb1OE MC38 cells into the flank and harvested 13 days post-engraftment. Tumor and spleen tissues were processed in parallel. Plots show live (DAPI-) versus dead (DAPI+) cell populations. 1
